    <p>Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter whose work had a profound influence on 20th-century art. Born on March 30, 1853, in the Netherlands, he is best known for his bold colors, dramatic brushwork, and emotional depth. Despite creating over 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, he struggled with mental health issues throughout his life.

        Some of his most famous works include "Starry Night," "Sunflowers," "The Bedroom," and "The Starry Night." Van Gogh's distinctive style is characterized by its vibrant colors and expressive brushstrokes. His use of color and form was innovative, paving the way for future artistic movements such as Expressionism.
        
        Van Gogh lived a turbulent life, marked by periods of severe mental illness. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, and his mental health struggles culminated in his tragic death on July 29, 1890, from a gunshot wound, which is often thought to have been self-inflicted.
        
        Interestingly, Van Gogh's work was not widely recognized during his lifetime, and he only sold a few paintings. It was only after his death that he gained fame, largely through the efforts of his brother Theo and other supporters. Today, he is celebrated as one of the most influential figures in Western art history.git</p>
